# @dvan/babel-preset-jsx

This is a temporary package for support jsx via babel preset

Because official package with issue [`cannot find @vue/babel-preset-jsx`](https://github.com/vuejs/jsx/issues/12)

Maybe they're too busy to work on this issue 😂

Options and usage see [vuejs/jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/jsx) and check `packages` for each options.

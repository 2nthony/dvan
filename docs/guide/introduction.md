# Introduction
Dvan now is a SPA generator powered by modern web tech, using Vue and webpack.

### Why named is Dvan?

Dark♂ Van(Van Darkholme) is a character who I realy like in some unserious videos

“	My name is Van. I'm an artist. I'm a performance artist. I'm hired for people to fulfill their fantasies, their DEEP♂DARK♂FANTASIES.	” ---- Van Darkholme

## Features
-	🚀 Zero config by default
-	📦 Out of box
-	💪 Powered of Vue and webpack
-	🔧 Hot reload with dev server
-	🔗 Built-in support `CSS` `Stylus`
-	🔨 Zero config support `Sass` `Less`

If something wrong with `node-sass`, here a way to resolve:
```bash
npm i -g mirror-config-china --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org
npm i node-sass
```

## Why Not Vue-Cli or Nuxt?
All is designed for building applications.

Dvan is no advantage compared to Vue-Cli and Nuxt, and they both have official support from Vue.

If you want to have the best development experience, highly recommend to use Vue-Cli or Nuxt.
